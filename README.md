# Introduction

A plug-in module for the module [Token Action HUD Core](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-action-hud-core) which adds support for the [Cypher System](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyphersystem).

## Behaviour reminders from HUD Core

- The Image of the items can be displayed by selecting 'Display Icons' in the HUD Core settings.
- Right clicking will open the item's window by selecting 'Open Item Sheet on Right-Click' in the HUD Core settings (right-clicking on a pool name will do nothing).

## Known Issues

When using the Chrome browser, if you want to use the ALT to change the default behaviour about opening the All-In-One dialog, then you need to hold down ALT before moving the mouse into the button and triggering the button.

## Installation
