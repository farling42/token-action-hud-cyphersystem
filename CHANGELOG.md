# CHANGELOG

## 0.5

- Use correct method for honouring the HUD Core option 'Open Item Sheet on Right-Click'.
- Change `doRegisterDefaultFlags` to return the default structure.

## 0.4.1

- Bump compatible version of HUD Core to 1.2 so that the module will work again.

## 0.4

- Support showing which recursions and tags are currently checked.
- Add icons to the buttons using the icon from the underyling item.
- Manually honour the HUD Core option "Display Icons".
- Open Item sheet on Right-Click (the Core option doesn't affect this behaviour).

## 0.3

- Add the Tags ("@") HUD title to support Recursions and Tags.
- Do not display archived items if the Actor's 'Hide Archive' setting is checked.
- General tidy up of old code.

## 0.2

- Insert translations available in the Cypher System language tables (there is no translation entry for "Pools", so I've used "Pool" for that purpose.)

## 0.1

- First version which provides basic support for Cypher System player character Actors.
