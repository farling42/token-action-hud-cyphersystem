# CHANGELOG

## 0.3

- Add the Tags ("@") HUD title to support Recursions and Tags.
- Do not display archived items if the Actor's 'Hide Archive' setting is checked.
- General tidy up of old code.

## 0.2

- Insert translations available in the Cypher System language tables (there is no translation entry for "Pools", so I've used "Pool" for that purpose.)

## 0.1

- First version which provides basic support for Cypher System player character Actors.
